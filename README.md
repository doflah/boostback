This is a tool for visualizing SpaceX missions.  The data is sourced from [FlightClub](http://flightclub.io).
For past missions with videos, points tracking stage locations will follow along with the video's current
timestamp.  Each stage trajectory is painted in a different color and orange segments represent burn durations.
