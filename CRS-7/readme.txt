CRS-7 disintegrated 139 seconds into the flight after launch from Cape Canaveral, just before the first stage was to
separate from the second stage.  Subsequent investigation traced the accident to the failure of a strut which secured
a helium bottle inside the 2nd stage LOX tank. With the helium pressurization system integrity breached, excess helium
quickly flooded the LOX tank, causing it to overpressurize and burst.

To display this in the app, I added two pseudo-stages to the Falcon 9 model that represent the planned trajectory.
Hopefully this will never be necessary in the future, but Booster.dat was split into a "_planned" dat file at the time
of the mission failure.  Last line of Booster.dat is the same as the first line of Booster_planned.dat so the polylines
connect.  Polylines that represent the intended mission are faded out to highlight the actual course of the mission.
